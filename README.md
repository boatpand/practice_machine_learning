for practice preprocess and fitting model with simple algorithm

I found the website that have dataset and guideline for crate model (https://twinsynergy.co.th/70-machine-learning-datasets-project-ideas/)
I try to do in topic Machine Learning Datasets for Data Science Beginners (Problem 1 - 9)

I upload files of ipynb & dataset in google drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GWxmIZCsPwKiDMAwCKvYsIha8903dTlx?usp=sharing
